  # accept - specify which kinds of messages this plugin accepts. Put each type on its own line.
  # You may optionally set :addressed_to_me => true to get only messages addressed to the bot.
  # For example,
  #   accept :text_message, :addressed_to_me => true
  # Will only accept text messages that are in the form "<bot name>, ..." or "... <bot name>".
  # The body of the message minus the bot name will be returned by the 'command' method of the
  # message.
  #
  # Message types are:
  #  - :all - all messages
  #  - :text_message - normal user text message
  #  - :paste_message - a paste
  #  - :enter_message - sent when a user enters the room
  #  - :leave_message - sent when a user leaves the room
  #  - :kick_message - sent when a user times out from inactivity
  #  - :lock_message - sent when the room is locked
  #  - :unlock_message - sent when the room is unlocked
  #  - :allow_guests_message - sent when guest access is turned on
  #  - :disallow_guests_message - sent when guest access is turned off
  #  - :topic_change_message - sent when the room's topic is changed
